# LINE-Break: Cryptanalysis and Reverse Engineering of Letter Sealing

LINE is a popular messaging platform used daily by millions of users in Southeast Asia -- most notably Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia.
It is particularly strong and an essential communication platform in Japan and Taiwan, with more than 85% of user adoption among the population.

We present a security analysis of the custom end-to-end encryption (E2EE) protocol underlying LINE, known as Letter Sealing v2.
Our findings show that Letter Sealing allows a TLS Man-in-the-Middle attacker or malicious server to violate integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of communications in various experimentally verified attacks.
